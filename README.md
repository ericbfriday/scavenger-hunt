This repository houses the homework assigned on August 29, 2017 for the Canopus cohort.

I can write in _italics_ using markdown. I can also **bold** words if I need to.

Lists are as easy as:
* walking down the street
* eating apple pie
* typing an asterisk

> Block Quotes are not terribly difficult, either!

 Now it's time to sleep. :zzz:
